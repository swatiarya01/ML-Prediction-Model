## House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

![House](house.jpg)

Welcome to the **House Price Prediction using Machine Learning** repository! In this project, we're diving into the world of data science and machine learning to predict house prices. Whether you're interested in real estate, machine learning, or simply curious about the power of data-driven insights, this project is for you.

### Introduction

Have you ever wondered if you could predict the price of a house based on its attributes? This project aims to do just that using machine learning techniques. We'll explore the Boston Housing dataset, preprocess the data, select an appropriate model, evaluate its performance, and even save the trained model for future predictions.

### Data

We'll be using the **Boston Housing** dataset for this project. It contains information about various factors that can influence house prices. From crime rates to the average number of rooms per dwelling, this dataset provides a rich set of attributes to work with.

### Data Exploration

We start by exploring the dataset, understanding its structure, and identifying potential correlations between attributes. We visualize the data using scatter plots and correlation matrices to gain insights into how different features relate to the target variable: house prices.

### Data Preprocessing

Before feeding the data into a machine learning model, we need to preprocess it. This involves handling missing values, performing feature scaling, and creating a pipeline that automates these steps. We'll use techniques like imputation and scaling to ensure that the data is ready for training.

### Model Selection

Choosing the right machine learning model is crucial for accurate predictions. In this project, we experiment with different models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. We'll discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model and select the one that performs the best.

### Model Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of our model is essential to ensure its accuracy and reliability. We use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify the quality of predictions. Cross-validation helps us validate our model's performance across multiple folds of data.

### Saving and Loading the Model

Once we have a trained model that meets our expectations, we save it using the `joblib` library. This allows us to reuse the model for future predictions without having to retrain it every time.

### Making Predictions

With a trained and saved model, we're ready to make predictions! We showcase how to input new data, preprocess it, and use the saved model to predict house prices. This step highlights the practical application of our machine learning solution.
